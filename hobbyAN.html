<button onclick="document.location='homepagesAN.html'"> ABOUT ME </button>


<p>My hobby is reading books. To specific it, I loves reading comics!</p>

<p align="Justify"> ðŸŒ¹ Before I started reading comics, I used to like watching the Cartoon Network on television. Doesn't that seem childish? But, even though I was sleepy at the time, I preferred cartoons to sleep. After my friends introduced me to Lawak Kampus, I began saving my pocket money in order to get my own at SMO Bookstores. Oh, I wish I had images to demonstrate how many of them I have at home.  </p>
<p align="Justify"> ðŸŒ¹ To my mind, the storyline in this comic is both straightforward and amusing at the same time. Even though it only has four pictures and a few phrases, it still makes me laugh out loud under my breath.  </p>
