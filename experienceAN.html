<h1> EXPERIENCE OF AQMAR NAJWA'S LIFE </h1>


<center><p> âž³ WHAT I HAVE LEARNED SO FAR: </p>
</center>

<p>ðŸŒ¼ Many things have taught me about life, from basic school to university. One of them is that we should not simply rely on people. It's because, sooner or later, they'll leave us, and we're the only ones who have our back. So, don't put too much of your happiness in the hands of others.</p>
	 <p>ðŸŒ¼ Next, we should be less kind to others and more kind to people who recognise your worth so that you are not wounded by others. However, the true challenge is to be kind to rude people, so just know your worth. </p>
	<p>ðŸŒ¼ Also, if life is proving to be tough and hard, simply enjoy and trust in your battle. Simply going with the flow will lead you to the solutions you seek.</p>
	<p>ðŸŒ¼ Don't show your progress so that others people will not know about your plan. Be humble in your life!</p>
